/*
Given an array arr[] of size N, check if it can be partitioned into two parts such that the sum of elements in both parts is the same.
    Example 1:
        Input: N = 4
        arr = {1, 5, 11, 5}
        Output: YES
        Explanation: 
        The two parts are {1, 5, 5} and {11}.

    Example 2:
        Input: N = 3
        arr = {1, 3, 5}
        Output: NO
        Explanation: This array can never be 
        partitioned into two such parts.
